# hand_of_the_king.py
# A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King is a game in which players take turns moving a purple card
# in a single direction around a grid of colored cards in order to collect cards of a chosen color.
# Players gain control of a color once they acquire an equal or greater number of cards compared to
# their opponents. The player in control of the most colors (there are seven colors total) when no
# more moves are available on the board is declared the winner.
